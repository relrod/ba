This is a collection of bioinformatics types and algorithms. It is currently
an experiment and shouldn't be used for production.

It takes a new approach to existing libraries such as `biocore` in that it
makes very heavy use of lens combinators. As such, we depend on `lens` -- and
we're not sorry. ;)
